# Copilot Instructions for This Repository

## Overview
- This repository is a collection of simple Python scripts for study and practice.
- All code is located in the `Baitap1/` directory. Each file is a standalone script.

## File Structure
- `Baitap1/bai1.py`: Prompts for two numbers, applies a conditional increment/decrement, multiplies, and prints the result.
- `Baitap1/bai2.py` and `Baitap1/bai3.py`: Each prints a simple string ("con Vit").

## Patterns and Conventions
- Scripts are written in Vietnamese and use basic Python syntax.
- Inputs are read using `input()`, and outputs are printed with `print()`.
- No external dependencies or modules are used.
- No test framework or build system is present; scripts are run directly with Python.

## How to Run
- Run any script from the command line:
  ```pwsh
  python Baitap1/bai1.py
  python Baitap1/bai2.py
  python Baitap1/bai3.py
  ```
- No arguments or environment setup is required.

## Contribution Guidance
- Add new scripts to the `Baitap1/` directory.
- Follow the simple, script-per-file pattern.
- Use clear, descriptive print statements and comments if needed.

## Example
```python
# Example: Adding a new script
print("Hello, world!")
```
